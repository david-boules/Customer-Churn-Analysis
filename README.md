# ðŸ“Š Bank Customer Churn Analysis

A Data Analysis report on customer churn using statistical inference, done as a project for the **MACT 3223 - Statistical Inference** course
---

## Project Overview

*Customer churn* is when a customer leaves a bank. This project analyzes a dataset of 10,000 bank customers to investigate the factors that are associated with churn including demographic and financial variables.

Our work includes:
- Descriptive summaries and visualizations
- Estimation of population parameters using confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing for group differences

## Research Objectives

These are the goals that will help us learn information about the population (all customers of this particular bank) using our sample of 10,000 customers:

1. **Customer Profiling:**
   *What does the average bank customer look like?*
   - Estimate characteristics such as age, balance, credit score, and estimated salary.
   - Construct a profile of the "average customer" using means and 95% confidence intervals.
   - Separate profiles are built for churned vs. retained customers.

2. **Gender-Based Churn Rate Differences:**
   *Do male and female customers experience significantly different churn rates?*
   - Compare churn rates of both gender groups using comparison of proportions.

3. **Geographical Churn Behavior:**
   *Are bank churn rates the same across international branches?*
   - Analyze both churn rates and certain financial metrics across regions.

4. **Salary Variability and Churn:**
   *How consistent are the salaries across churners and non-churners?*
   - Understand the stability and spread of income levels among different customer groups.

5. **Customer Activity and Retention:**
   *Does being an active member make one more likely to stay with the bank?*
   - Determine the relationship (if any) between a customer's activity and their churn behavior.
